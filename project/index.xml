      <description>Mizzu Cho (mc63696)  Introduction # For this project, I want to study the relationship between # the humidity and the number of covid cases in Korea. # Therefore, I have chosen the dataset containing the number # of confirmed covid cases everyday from January 2020 to # June2020 in each province of Korea and the dataset # containing the weather record in each province of Korea. # I&amp;#39;m going to calculate the average humidity of each # province every month between January and June as one # variable.</description>

      <description>Mizzu Cho (mc63696)  Atlantic Hurricanes I will be introducing the datatset about US Atlantic hurricanes. The dataset includes 13 different variables such as atmospheric pressure at landfall, estimated damage in millions of dollars, and deaths, for named hurricanes that made landfall in the US mainland from 1950 through to 2012 and the dataset involves 94 different hurricanes (observations). I&#39;m going to look in whether the mean financial damages caused the hurricane differ between LA, TX, and FL.</description>
